  abstract = {There is growing evidence of the influence of northern hemisphere (NH) anthropogenic aerosols (AA) on the observed regional climate change over Asia in the recent few decades. While the radiative effects of AA can regionally offset the greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, their combined impacts on the South Asian monsoon (SAM) are not adequately understood. The present study examines the individual and combined effects of GHG and AA forcing on the SAM precipitation response, based on numerical experiments conducted using the IITM Earth System Model version2 (IITM-ESMv2). We performed the following three sets of 50-year simulations based on the CMIP6 forcing (a) AER: where the atmospheric CO2 concentration is fixed to the pre-industrial level (i.e., year 1850) and AA levels correspond to the year 2005 (b) GHG: CO2 concentration corresponds to the year 2005 and AA levels correspond to the year 1850 (c) COMB: Both CO2 concentration and AA levels correspond to the year 2005. The three experiments are compared against the pre-industrial control (PICTL) run of the IITM-ESMv2. An intensification of SAM precipitation is noted in GHG relative to PICTL, whereas AER exhibits a decrease of SAM precipitation and weakening of monsoon circulation in response to the AA forcing. The results show that absorption of shortwave radiation above the atmospheric boundary layer over the Asian region creates surface radiation deficit and stabilizes the lower troposphere, leading to a slowdown of monsoonal winds, reduced evaporation over the Indian Ocean and decreased moisture convergence over South and Southeast Asia. A striking finding from our analysis is the reinforced suppression of SAM precipitation and organized monsoon convection in COMB, which results from an enhanced inter-hemispheric asymmetry in radiative forcing under the combined influence of the elevated CO2 and AA forcing. Furthermore, both the AER and COMB experiments reveal a widespread suppression of large-scale organized monsoon convective activity on sub-seasonal time-scales over South and Southeast Asia.},

This study examines observed and projected long-term changes in the MJO phase speed using four twentieth-century reanalyses and CMIP6 simulations.

We attribute the overall acceleration of the MJO to the global warming-driven increase in the meridional moisture gradient around the warm pool while attributing the multidecadal variability in the MJO phase speed to changes in the zonal moisture gradient associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

The diverse natural ecosystems in India are poorly represented in these models due to the absence any of integrated data-model framework and intercomparison study so far. To partially address this, we have used flux-tower measurements in this study to simulate the gross primary productivity (GPP), sensible (H), and latent heat fluxes (LE) of a moist semi-evergreen deciduous forest in the Kaziranga National Park in subtropical Northeast India using a process-based model ISAM. The model is calibrated using two years of measurement which improves its performance when subsequently run to simulate these fluxes for a year. The model produced annual GPP, mean maximum H, and LE are 2432.26 gC m-2 y-1, 29 and 82 W m-2 respectively as compared to their measured values i.e. 2398.47 gC m-2 y-1, 26 and 73 W m-2 correspondingly. Additionally, we report the calibrated model biogeochemical and biogeophysical parameters which will be useful to simulate the fluxes in this forest using the aforementioned models.},

  abstract = {This study uses near-decade-long OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction (XCO2) to understand CO2 dynamics across the Arabian Peninsula (AP). The XCO2 over the AP exhibits strong seasonality, with considerably high and low concentrations during spring and autumn, respectively. Local CO2 fluxes, predominantly from anthropogenic sources, do not display seasonal variations, resulting in minimal impact on the seasonal XCO2 cycle across the AP. Analyses of CarbonTracker model outputs reveal a considerable north-to-south transport of CO2, mainly from Europe and adjacent areas and confined between the low and middle levels of the atmosphere. The seasonal XCO2 cycle observed in the AP clearly replicates the seasonality of this transport pattern. Furthermore, a cross-correlation analysis shows a lag of approximately 1 month in CO2 concentrations between Europe and the AP, with the former preceding the latter. The transport of CO2 from Europe is influenced by considerable variations in local fluxes across the Europe. From winter to early spring, net positive CO2 fluxes occur due to high respiration, increasing local CO2 levels. Conversely, from summer to early autumn, net negative fluxes arise from enhanced uptake, reducing local CO2 concentrations. These concentrations of CO2 are subsequently transported to the AP, driven by synoptic-scale systems (shamal winds) moving toward the region. The evolution of El Ni\~no conditions considerably amplifies the XCO2 levels over the AP by up to approximately 1~ppm. Notably, during the peak phase of the recent 2015--2016~El Ni\~no, we noted strongly positive anomalies over the southern latitudes, which subsequently migrated to the AP.},

The HGFM model has a wave number truncation of 1534 in the cubic octahedral grid. The monsoon events have been predicted with a ten-day lead time. The HGFM model is compared to the operational GFS T1534. While the HGFM provides skills comparable to the GFS, it shows better skills for higher precipitation thresholds.

To understand the plausible reason(s) for the weakening frequency of MDs in the southern Bay of Bengal in recent decades, we examine some of the seasonal average in-situ atmospheric parameters important for tropical cyclogenesis; we use various observational data from the IMD and three atmospheric climate reanalysis datasets to account for possible quality constraints in them. Our findings suggest that the observed weakening of MD frequency south of 20{$^\circ$}N in the Bay of Bengal since 1950s is likely due to a declining trend in the mid-tropospheric relative humidity over the Indian region. Our numerical sensitivity experiments support this finding.},

Realistic simulation of the IOD and Indian summer monsoon connection, however, remains a challenge in many of the state-of-the-art climate models. This study presents an analysis of IOD and its links to the Indian monsoon based on the historical simulations from the IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) and other models that participated in the 6th phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Our findings indicate that the IITM-ESM provides not only a fairly realistic simulation of the ocean--atmosphere coupled interactions and the Bjerknes feedback processes associated with IOD events but also better captures the summer monsoon precipitation response over the Indian subcontinent during IOD events, as compared to several CMIP6 models. The physical mechanisms contributing to the improved simulation of IOD and its monsoon connection in the IITM-ESM are evaluated in this study.},

Despite their significance, the occurrence and drivers of CDHW events remain inadequately understood, particularly in arid regions such as the Arabian Peninsula (AP). Using fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics and variability of CDHW events over the AP from 1980 to 2023. Our results reveal a substantial increase in the frequency and intensity of CDHW events over this period, with a fourfold increase in the affected area since 1998. The northern parts of the AP are particularly vulnerable to CDHW events, due to the strong synchronization of heatwaves and droughts, derived by dominant role of temperature. We identify a robust linkage between CDHWs and large-scale circulation indices, notably the positive phase of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the negative phase of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) have favored pronounced CDHWs over the past two decades. The AMO variability primary influences the mid-tropospheric pressure system leading to substantial temperature variations in the AP. However, the PDO largely impacts upper-level zonal winds, which modulate the strength of the subtropical westerly jet and subsequently changes the AP precipitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for adaptive strategies and resilient measures to mitigate the adverse effects of CDHWs in a rapidly changing climate.},

Analysis of the 120-year historical record suggests that the relationship between the AMO and the SASM has weakened in recent decades. Two possible reasons emerge from the analyses of observational datasets and model experiments. Enhanced Indian Ocean warming and weakened North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) are the prime factors weakening AMO-SASM association in the recent decades. Indian Ocean warming co-occurred during the recent AMO warm phase weakens the meridional temperature gradient, weakening the regional Hadley cell, large-scale monsoon circulation and precipitation. The suppressed convection triggers a Rossby wave which manifests as a cyclonic circulation over west central Asia weakening the Tibetan anticyclone. In addition, weakening of NASH weakens the Circum-Global Teleconnection (CGT) connecting AMO to the SASM, leading to weakening of AMO-SASM association. Projected warming of the Indian Ocean and Atlantic demands better understanding of the AMO-SASM teleconnection and their projected changes for assessing future changes in SASM in a warming world.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of interannual variability of Arabian Sea (AS) mixing is studied by examining its energetics from 60 years of model output (1950--2009) generated using an ocean general circulation model. The model results are compared with ocean reanalysis data for the same period. Both model and reanalysis data show consistent patterns of interannual variability of AS mixing. It is observed that the dominant mode of interannual variability has a basin-wide structure with monotonic sign throughout the basin, albeit with a higher intensity in the central and southeast regions of the AS. The variability is primarily controlled by El Ni o-Southern Oscillation with shallower (deeper) mixed layer during El Ni o (La Ni a). During a typical La Ni a year, the wind stress forcing, heat fluxes, and evaporation minus precipitation together cause deepening of mixed layer depth (MLD) in AS. This MLD variability has the strongest signal in winter months (i.e., December to February [DJF]). Further, the resolved mixing energetics suggest that the dominant forcing of MLD variability changes with seasons and has a regional preference. Buoyancy production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) governs the mixing and associated MLD variability in central AS during September to November (SON) and in northeast AS during DJF. Both buoyancy and mechanical production of TKE govern MLD variability in southwest to central AS from June to August and southeast AS in SON. Thus, the study highlights basin-wide structure of interannual variability of AS mixing along with its controlling mechanisms with strong regional dependency owing to the contrasting nature of forcing prevailing over various parts of the AS.},

While the CFSv2 model has been skillful in predicting the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) on seasonal time scales, a century-long simulation with it shows biases in the ocean mixed layer, resulting in a 1.5{$^\circ$}C cold bias in the global mean surface air temperature, a cold bias in the sea surface temperature (SST), and a cooler-than-observed troposphere. These biases limit the utility of CFSv2 to study climate change issues. To address biases, and to develop an Indian Earth System Model (IITM ESMv1), the ocean component in CFSv2 was replaced at IITM with an improved version, having better physics and interactive ocean biogeochemistry. A 100-yr simulation with the new coupled model (with biogeochemistry switched off) shows substantial improvements, particularly in global mean surface temperature, tropical SST, and mixed layer depth. The model demonstrates fidelity in capturing the dominant modes of climate variability such as the ENSO and Pacific decadal oscillation. The ENSO--ISM teleconnections and the seasonal leads and lags are also well simulated.

While these systematic errors can be partly reduced by increasing the horizontal atmospheric resolution of the models, they also illustrate our incomplete understanding of the key mechanisms controlling the position of the ITCZ during boreal summer. Using a large collection of coupled models and dedicated coupled experiments, we show that these tropical rainfall errors are partly associated with insufficient surface thermal forcing and incorrect representation of the surface albedo over the Northern Hemisphere continents. Improving the parameterization of the land albedo in two global coupled models leads to a large reduction of these systematic errors and further demonstrates that the Northern Hemisphere subtropical deserts play a seminal role in these improvements through a heat low mechanism.},

  abstract = {The barrier layer (BL) is part of the surface ocean isolated from the local air-sea exchange processes despite it's great potential to store the heat beneath the mixed layer. The tropical oceans are known for the presence of BL. The interannual variability of the BL of the tropical Indian Ocean is examined in this study with a concomitant analysis of observations and outputs from an ocean general circulation model. The model faithfully reproduces the tropical variability of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the Indian Ocean when compared with observations and other studies. The BL thins (thickens) in the eastern (central-to-western) tropical Indian Ocean during the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IOD). The individual roles of five major forcing mechanisms on BL-IOD coupling are examined. The thinning in the east is caused by upward heaving thermocline due to upwelling Kelvin waves during the positive phase of the IOD, causing the isothermal layer to shoal steeper than the mixed layer. The surface freshwater fluxes substantiate the thinning of BL in the east during this time, while the net heat fluxes thin the BL in the entire tropical Indian Ocean. The basin-wide salinity (temperature) dynamics have widespread and complementary impacts, a BL thickening (thinning) in the equatorial and eastern tropical Indian Ocean during positive IOD years, with the former overwhelming the latter. The thickening of BL in the central-to-western tropical Indian Ocean during positive IOD is due to a combined action of salinity and freshwater forcing. The thermocline heaving, temperature and salinity dynamics and buoyancy forcing could explain the net variability of BL in the tropical Indian Ocean almost entirely in the model. The ocean-only response shows that a BL weakens the shoaling (deepening) of the ocean mixed layer during positive (negative) IOD years in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. As barrier layers store heat beneath the mixed layer, their role in Indian Ocean weather and climate needs to be examined with coupled model experiments.},

  abstract = {The role of coupled processes in the Madden--Julian Oscillation (MJO) is investigated in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Monthly Forecasting System. A series of forecasts initialized daily for 47 days during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE) period are performed with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) provided by persistence of initial conditions, and coupling to either a full dynamical ocean model with vertical resolution in the upper ocean typical of coupled models (10 m), or, a 1D mixed layer ocean model with high ({$\sim$}1 m) vertical resolution in the upper ocean. The experiment with the full dynamical model shows improved skill compared with the persisted SST experiment, indicating a role for coupled processes in the MJO. The experiment with the mixed layer model shows a further improvement in skill over the full dynamical ocean, particularly for the phases of the MJO where the convection is active over the Indian Ocean or West Pacific. This further improvement comes about from an enhanced sensitivity of the SST to the surface flux anomalies associated with the MJO. Additional sensitivity experiments reveal that the improved representation of the diurnal cycle which results from the increased vertical resolution is a significant factor in the improved skill of the experiments with the mixed layer model.
