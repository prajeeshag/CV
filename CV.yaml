          - Implemented mosaic grid for surface flux computation IITM-ESM, resolving flux-transfer inconsistencies over sea-ice and land-ocean boundaries. This significantly improved the sea-ice simulations and the global energy budget ([Swapna et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001262)).
          - Developed post-processing software in Python, C, and Fortran, leveraging NetCDF4 and GRIB libraries to streamline data analysis and visualization workflows.
          - Conducted climate change analysis, contributing to understanding of anthropogenic influences on climate dynamics

      - company: Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
        position: Scientist-B
        location: Pune, India
        start_date: 2013-01
        end_date: 2015-12
        highlights:
          - Implemented concurrent coupling using FMS coupler to enhance the throughput of the IITM-ESM model, optimizing resource utilization and computational efficiency.
          - Identified and resolved memory leak issues in the IITM-ESM using Valgrind, ensuring model stability and reliability.
          - Conducted comprehensive performance analysis of IITM-ESM using Allinea MAP, pinpointing and addressing bottlenecks to optimize overall performance and efficiency.
