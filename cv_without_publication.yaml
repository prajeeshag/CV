        highlights:
          - Developed a new spectral dynamical core ([Spec2d](https://github.com/prajeeshag/spec2d)) for the atmospheric model of [IITM-ESM](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/clim_esm_one.jsp). Used non-blocking MPI communications, distributed array traspose and FFT capabilities of FFTW library to enable efficient 2D domain decomposition. This vastly improved scalability and throughput.
          - Developed a high-resolution (6km) global forecast model ([HGFM](https://srf.tropmet.res.in/srf/hgfm/)) for Short Range Forecasting by implementing a novel TCO grid, enhancing prediction accuracy and resolution ([Phani et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-89)).
          - Implemented MPI parallelization in the Ocean Dynamics Thermodynamic Model ([ODTM](https://www.valsala-orl.net/ODTM.htm)), boosting model throughput by up to 30 times, thus accelerating simulations and analysis.
          - Investigated Monsoon, IOD, and ENSO phenomena, employing CMIP6 data to explore the interactions and feedback mechanisms, with publications in peer-reviewed journals
          - Lead a team of 3-4 scientists in developing and enhancing IITM-ESM, overseeing project milestones and ensuring alignment with research objectives.

        position: Scientist-B
        location: Pune, India
        start_date: 2013-01
        end_date: 2015-12
        highlights:
          - Implemented concurrent coupling using FMS coupler to enhance the throughput of the IITM-ESM model, optimizing resource utilization and computational efficiency.
          - Identified and resolved memory leak issues in the IITM-ESM using Valgrind, ensuring model stability and reliability.
          - Conducted comprehensive performance analysis of IITM-ESM using Allinea MAP, pinpointing and addressing bottlenecks to optimize overall performance and efficiency.
