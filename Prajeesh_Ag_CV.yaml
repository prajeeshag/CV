        highlights:
          - Pioneered a groundbreaking spectral dynamical core for the atmospheric model of [IITM-ESM](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/clim_esm_one.jsp), enabling 2D domain decomposition in both spectral and grid point domains using FFTW library. This innovation vastly improved scalability and throughput.
          - Engineered a high-resolution (6km) global forecast model ([HGFM](https://srf.tropmet.res.in/srf/hgfm/)) for Short Range Forecasting by implementing a novel TCO grid in  the GFS model TCO grid, enhancing prediction accuracy and resolution.
          - Implemented MPI parallelization in the Ocean Dynamics Thermodynamic Model ([ODTM](https://www.valsala-orl.net/ODTM.htm)), boosting model throughput by up to 30 times, thus accelerating simulations and analysis.
          - Investigated Monsoon, IOD, and ENSO phenomena, employing CMIP6 data to elucidate interactions and feedback mechanisms, with publications in peer-reviewed journals
          - Directed a team of 3-4 scientists in the development and enhancement of IITM-ESM, overseeing project milestones and ensuring alignment with research objectives.

        end_date: 2019-12
        highlights:
          - Managed and oversaw the CMIP6 experiments conducted with IITM-ESM.
          - Orchestrated production workflows essential for CMIP6 simulations of IITM-ESM on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems
          - Architected an intuitive and modular I/O manager for IITM-ESM, harnessing modern Fortran's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capabilities alongside NetCDF4, facilitating data handling and interoperability.
          - Spearheaded the implementation of fractional grid for surface flux computation, resolving flux-transfer inconsistencies over sea-ice and land-ocean boundaries. This enhancement significantly bolstered sea-ice simulations ([Swapna et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001262)).
          - Developed post-processing software in Python, C, and Fortran, leveraging NetCDF4 and GRIB libraries to streamline data analysis and visualization workflows.
          - Conducted climate change analysis, contributing to understanding of anthropogenic influences on climate dynamics
