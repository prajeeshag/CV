        # end_date: 2004-08
        highlights:
          - Developed a regional coupled climate model for subseasonal to seasonal scale prediction over Arabian Peninsula region.
            WRF and MITgcm were coupled using ESMF coupler
          - Developed CLI preprocessing utility in Python for generating and manipulating input data for the coupled model
          - Implemented seasonal pediction system for Arabian Peninsula region. 
            A fault tolerant automated workflow for a 50 ensemble system is developed using Cylc workflow engine

      - company: Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
        position: Scientist-D
        location: Pune, India
        start_date: 2020-01
        end_date: 2022-12
        highlights:
          - Developed a novel spectral dynamical core for the atmospheric model of [IITM-ESM](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/clim_esm_one.jsp), 
            enabling 2D domain decomposition in both spectral and grid point domains using FFTW library. 
            This innovation significantly enhances scalability and throughput of the Model
          - Developed a high resolution (6km) global forecast model using TCO grid for Short Range Forecasting
          - Implemented MPI parallelisation in Ocean Dynamics Thermodynamic Model [ODTM](https://www.valsala-orl.net/ODTM.htm),
            which improved the throughput of the model upto 30 times
          - Supervised a team of 3-4 scientists working on IITM-ESM development 

      - company: Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
        position: Scientist-C
        location: Pune, India
        start_date: 2016-01
        end_date: 2019-12
        highlights:
          - Development of a easy to use and modular I/O manager for IITM-ESM using the OOP capabilities of mordern Fortran and NetCDF4
          - Implemented fractional grid for surface flux computation, resolving inconsistencies in flux-transfer 
            over sea-ice and land-ocean boundaries. Significantly improved sea-ice simulations as a result [(Swapna et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001262). 
          - Developed post-processing softwares in Python, C and Fortran using NetCDF4 and GRIB libraries

      - company: Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
        position: Scientist-B
        location: Pune, India
        start_date: 2013-01
        end_date: 2015-12
        highlights:
          - Implemented concurrent coupling using FMS coupler to increase the throughput of the IITM-ESM model
          - Identified memory leak issues in the IITM-ESM using Valgrind and fixed it
          - Did performance analysis of IITM-ESM using Allinea MAP and identified bottle necks
