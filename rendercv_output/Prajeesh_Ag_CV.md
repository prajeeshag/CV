# Experience

## Climate Change Center, KAUST, Research Specialist

- Jan. 2023 to present 
- Jeddah, KSA 
- Developed a regional coupled climate model tailored for subseasonal to seasonal scale forecasting across the Arabian Peninsula region. Integrated WRF and MITgcm through ESMF coupler, optimizing performance and accuracy
- Crafted a Command-Line Interface (CLI) preprocessing utility in Python, streamlining data generation, manipulation and visualization for the coupled model, enhancing efficiency and ease of use
- Orchestrated a fault-tolerant automated workflow, leveraging Cylc workflow engine to manage a 50-member ensemble system for seasonal prediction over the Arabian Peninsula

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-D

- Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2022 
- Pune, India 
- Pioneered a groundbreaking spectral dynamical core for the atmospheric model of [IITM-ESM](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/clim_esm_one.jsp), enabling 2D domain decomposition in both spectral and grid point domains using FFTW library. This innovation vastly improved scalability and throughput.
- Engineered a high-resolution (6km) global forecast model ([HGFM](https://srf.tropmet.res.in/srf/hgfm/)) for Short Range Forecasting by implementing a novel TCO grid in  the GFS model TCO grid, enhancing prediction accuracy and resolution.
- Implemented MPI parallelization in the Ocean Dynamics Thermodynamic Model ([ODTM](https://www.valsala-orl.net/ODTM.htm)), boosting model throughput by up to 30 times, thus accelerating simulations and analysis.
- Investigated Monsoon, IOD, and ENSO phenomena, employing CMIP6 data to elucidate interactions and feedback mechanisms, with publications in peer-reviewed journals
- Directed a team of 3-4 scientists in the development and enhancement of IITM-ESM, overseeing project milestones and ensuring alignment with research objectives.

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-C

- Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2019 
- Pune, India 
- Managed and oversaw the CMIP6 experiments conducted with IITM-ESM.
- Orchestrated production workflows essential for CMIP6 simulations of IITM-ESM on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems
- Architected an intuitive and modular I/O manager for IITM-ESM, harnessing modern Fortran's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capabilities alongside NetCDF4, facilitating data handling and interoperability.
- Spearheaded the implementation of fractional grid for surface flux computation, resolving flux-transfer inconsistencies over sea-ice and land-ocean boundaries. This enhancement significantly bolstered sea-ice simulations ([Swapna et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001262)).
- Developed post-processing software in Python, C, and Fortran, leveraging NetCDF4 and GRIB libraries to streamline data analysis and visualization workflows.
- Conducted climate change analysis, contributing to understanding of anthropogenic influences on climate dynamics

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-B

- Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2015 
- Pune, India 
- Engineered concurrent coupling using FMS coupler to enhance the throughput of the IITM-ESM model, optimizing resource utilization and computational efficiency.
- Identified and resolved memory leak issues in the IITM-ESM using Valgrind, ensuring model stability and reliability.
- Conducted comprehensive performance analysis of IITM-ESM using Allinea MAP, pinpointing and addressing bottlenecks to optimize overall performance and efficiency.
