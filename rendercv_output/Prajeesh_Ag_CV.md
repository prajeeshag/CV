# Experience

## Climate Change Center, KAUST, Research Specialist

- Jan. 2023 to present 
- Jeddah, KSA 
- Developed a regional coupled climate model for subseasonal to seasonal scale prediction over Arabian Peninsula region. WRF and MITgcm were coupled using ESMF coupler
- Developed CLI preprocessing utility in Python for generating and manipulating input data for the coupled model
- Implemented seasonal pediction system for Arabian Peninsula region. A fault tolerant automated workflow for a 50 ensemble system is developed using Cylc workflow engine

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-D

- Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2022 
- Pune, India 
- Developed a novel spectral dynamical core for the atmospheric model of [IITM-ESM](http://cccr.tropmet.res.in/home/clim_esm_one.jsp), enabling 2D domain decomposition in both spectral and grid point domains using FFTW library. This innovation significantly enhances scalability and throughput of the Model
- Developed a high resolution (6km) global forecast model ([HGFM](https://srf.tropmet.res.in/srf/hgfm/)) using TCO grid for Short Range Forecasting
- Implemented MPI parallelisation in Ocean Dynamics Thermodynamic Model [ODTM](https://www.valsala-orl.net/ODTM.htm), which improved the throughput of the model upto 30 times
- Supervised a team of 3-4 scientists working on IITM-ESM development

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-C

- Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2019 
- Pune, India 
- Development of a easy to use and modular I/O manager for IITM-ESM using the OOP capabilities of mordern Fortran and NetCDF4
- Implemented fractional grid for surface flux computation, resolving inconsistencies in flux-transfer over sea-ice and land-ocean boundaries. Significantly improved sea-ice simulations as a result [(Swapna et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017MS001262).
- Developed post-processing softwares in Python, C and Fortran using NetCDF4 and GRIB libraries

## Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Scientist-B

- Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2015 
- Pune, India 
- Implemented concurrent coupling using FMS coupler to increase the throughput of the IITM-ESM model
- Identified memory leak issues in the IITM-ESM using Valgrind and fixed it
- Did performance analysis of IITM-ESM using Allinea MAP and identified bottle necks
